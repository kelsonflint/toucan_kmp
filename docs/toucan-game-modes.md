So far we have a basic drinking game with simple prompts. 
We can weave in fun minigames, viruses, and other mechanisms to make the game more interesting.

I was thinking that we could expand the scope of the app to have different game modes that leverage
the idea of prompts, but require different user interactions. 
A couple of random ideas

Toucan Drink - select a deck and start playing (the first ever game mode)

It takes Tou - 2 player game where you ask each other personal questions to get to know each other.
We can have 3 stages (decks) which progressively get more real/intimate.

Toucan Discuss - Multi player game, user takes turn, 3 prompts are displayed at once, user gets to
select which one they get to read out to the group. These prompts should be deep. The goal is to
foster discussion and reflection among the group. 

Toucan Charades - User puts phone to forehead facing the group. Prompt is displayed and the group
tries to help the user guess what it is. These prompts would be very simple, but could be compacted
into various decks and themes for the charades. I would want the user to be able to shake the phone
in order to go to the next prompt because they can't see the screen. 
I believe the view will look very similar, but the interactions with the prompts will be different. Existing game mode
requires a tap to move on, then we exhaust the available prompts, then the game ends. For this game mode, I would like it to be timed. Each round is 60seconds. This allows
for one player to guess for the entire round. The game is played in landscape mode. If they guess right, they can tilt the phone down, marking the prompt as successful and
move to the next one. If they want to pass, they can tilt the phone up to the sky, marking that prompt as unsuccessful  and move to the next
